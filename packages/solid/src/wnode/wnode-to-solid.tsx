/**
 * Converts a framework-agnostic WNode descriptor to a Solid JSX element.
 *
 * Creates wolfie-box/wolfie-text native elements directly, bypassing the
 * high-level Box/Text component layers (which add context-based defaults and
 * className resolution). The WNode's style is already fully computed by the
 * render function, so the native elements are sufficient.
 *
 * Must be called within a Solid reactive context. Components should return
 * `() => wNodeToSolid(renderXxx(...))` so that signal reads inside renderXxx
 * are tracked and the output updates when state changes.
